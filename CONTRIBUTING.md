============

Please try to follow the general style of the app.
That's certainly not the best but I prefer consistency over elegance for the sake of maintainability.

Import only what you use from external modules (except `ClassyPrelude`) or use qualified imports, it makes it easier to keep track of things.

Export the strict necessary.

Use abbreviations as little as possible, except for making long names shorter.

Always write the type signatures for functions.

Lint.
